# The Weather Forecast Java Client Server Application
The client asks the server for the weather in his city, and the server returns the forecast to the client
Creates two different programs that run on different computers but at the same time work together and send data to each other
To communicate programs with each other, I created a universal class Phone and used it both on the server and the client in a JAR file
I added multithreading to the server side so that the server can handle multiple clients at the same time
