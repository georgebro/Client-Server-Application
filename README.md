# The Weather Forecast Java Client Server Application
The client requests the weather forecast for their city from the server, and the server responds with the forecast
Creates two different programs that run on different computers, but at the same time work together and send data to each other
To communicate between programs, I created a universal class, Phone, and used it on both the server and the client in a JAR file
I added multithreading to the server side so that the server can handle multiple clients at the same time
