# The Weather Forecast
# JAVA Client Server Application

Client asking to server for the weather in his city and server returns the forecast to the client
Creates two different programs that runs on different computers but at the same time works together and sending data to each other
To communicate programs with each other, i created a universal class Phone, and uses it both on the server and on the client in a JAR file
I added multithreading to the server side, so that server can handle multiple clients at the same time
